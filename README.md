# Measurement Scripts for the OCS QP Project:

## Measurement Checklist:

- [x] Resonator spectroscopy
- [x] Punchout
- [ ] qubit spectroscopy over broad range to detect higher order frequencies (up to w_03)
- [ ] Resonator spectroscopy (high averages, small span) at res freqs
- [ ] Single shot measurement of resonator at res freq for histogram (goal: see two peaks)
- [ ] Ramsey interference measurement to determine the instantaneous n_g
- [ ] Single-shot readout of charge parity
- [ ] Charge parity dynamics timeseries measurement
- [ ] basic qubit characterization (T1,T2R,T2E) [OPTIONAL]
